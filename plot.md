# Overall

1. Alien envades the earth
2. Army calls us to lead the saving mission.
3. We find zerg-like, highly organized alien groups claiming the city.
4. Get back the city by:
   1. Freeing the buildings from aliens
   2. Sending sitizens to safety
   3. Growing army
   4. Eradicating more aliens
   5. Taking over samples of aliens to labs
   6. Getting better equipment from researchers
5. At some point researchers find alien material that defies gravity,
   and that it can be crafted using earth materials
6. As we take back the city, we go to save even more.
7. Alien ambushes are a thing now, they take cities back in more violent manner.
   - Air bombing witch infectious biomass.
   - Some city regions will require exterminators with fire/electric weapons to take back.
8. Researchers make first flighting jet thingy that can fly without charge for hundreds of hours.
   - Better resque transport, expensive, but very fast, and have decreasing cost curve as the game progresses
   - A bit later gives flying firepower with similar progression.
9. Save countries on scale of cities instead of cities on scale of individual buildings
10.

# Start

We are playing as retired captain, just enjoying the rest of our life near the pond, fishing.
As we return home, loud, explosion-like sound can be heard.
When you're home, were're greeted by phone
